## Mud content

Workflow to spatially predict the content of mud (silt and clay) of seafloor surface sediments in Norway, based on measured grain-size data and predictor variables.

### Model outputs

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted additive log-ratio (alr)

* Area of applicability of the alr model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)

* Mud content calculated from alr
