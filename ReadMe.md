## GSMgrids

Workflow to spatially predict the content of mud (silt and clay) of seafloor surface sediments in Norway, based on measured grain-size data and predictor variables.

### Main characteristics

Variable pre-selection with Boruta algorithm and de-correlation analysis.

Spatial predictions with Random Forest including spatial 10-fold cross validation and model tuning (mtry and final variable selection with forward feature selection).

Estimation of the area of applicability of the model.
